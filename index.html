    <div class="w3-container" id="session1" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 1</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Sat in the Roaring Giant tavern to discuss a new guild. Some names were thrown around, but no decision was made. An idea was floated to make a town rather than a guild.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        An exceptionally large woman named Vicky, the tavern owner, brought you drinks and asked you to help get Wratz out of the cellar. You helped her out for a free round of drinks. You learned of a minor wolf problem the town is having.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Stopped in at The People’s Hilt blacksmith for some supplies and learned of a gold wager on a wrestling match with Wratz (Thermund)
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Stopped in at the general store, Jugs and Trinkets. The owner, Cora, sold you some tents and offered to pay for wolf pelts (5gp/ea). She has been having trouble sleeping with all the howling noises.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Setup camp near the forest’s edge by the Roaring Giant after paying your bar tab. Thurmund was used as bait, but only baited Wratz. Wratz was confused and ran away. Searching for him, you spread out to find the source of the howling. Galdur was attacked but fought one off. It was tracked to a cave entrance.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You cleared out the cave and found a dead human male with an axe wound in his back. Brought body back to town. Heading back to camp to rest for the night, you were awoken by Galdur’s screams as he transformed into a werewolf. He was attempting to flee, but you held him down and tied him up until morning. He’s back to his old self and having a conversation with Thurmund.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Session 2 -->
    <div class="w3-container" id="session2" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 2</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Galdur got tired of talking and waiting to eat, so he went off on his own back to the Roaring Giant Tavern. You brought the dead body from the cave into the tavern and got kicked out by Vicky. She came out to see if she knew who it was, she did not.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Darke and Gilbert went off to buy a shovel at the general store. They each bought one, cashed in their pelts, and headed back to the tavern. Gurn went to see about buying some more powerful weapons and met Aldaire who recently partnered with the jeweler for a place to sell his wares. They were much too expensive, but he did agree to do some research on how to cure a werewolf. The jeweler had the shit kicked out of him and his boots stolen. He offered 30gp if someone could get them back from the bandits that took them.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Thurmund and Slappy sat down in the tavern with Galdur. Galdur was very aggrivated, threw his steak, insulted the owner, and stormed off. Thurmund attempted to hold him back but got a bloody nose instead.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        After finding out the location of the local graveyard, you decided to go bury the body. Thurmund made a quick stop at the general store on the way. When he couldn't afford a healing potion, he hit on the owner who was flattered and offered a discount. When it wasn't enough, he attempted to threaten her instead and was laughed at.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        While burying the body you found a felled tree that was preventing a boat from continuing down the river. You were careful since it looked suspicious and you found a spec of blood in the boat. Gurn wanted to pull the boat ashore, so Thurmund threw a rope before realizing he forgot to add a hook to the end. Slappy hopped into the boat and grabbed on so it could be pulled. It was hard to lift above the steep edge, but it was pulled up. Gurn named it "The Unsinkable 2".
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You were jumped by bandits but dispatched them with little difficulty. You rested until dusk and headed up the trail where one of the bandits tried to flee. The cave was setup as a hideout, and you were warned away but fought your way through. Vampire spawn climbed down from the walls and attacked, warning you that Margravine and Helmuth would be back soon, and they were mad that you "killed their puppy". After struggling with the fast-healing vampire spawn, a werewolf (Galdur) showed up and began attacking them. You learned that running water hurt them more than they could heal. After dispatching the spawn and lopping their heads off, you found the boots and left the cave.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        On the way back to Drumstone you encountered a campsite surrounded by dead bodies. Helmuth and Margravine blocked the path and demanded the "mutt". Thurmund was hesitant, but Galdur immediately surrendered. Seeing that not everyone was giving in to their demand, they landed a few blows and the rest of the party surrendered. They grabbed Galdur and threw a crumpled piece of paper and said to come visit sometime. It is a map to a place called Amaranthine Keep.

        Headed back to town to find it on fire and under attack
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Ran into tavern, saw giant bear crush a vampire spawn's head
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Wratz got between you and the bear, learned it was Vicky
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        She led you through a secret passage and filled you in on some history between vampires and lycanthropes
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Led to Fort Level, met Oloric who added to the story: Geirolf and Orlok
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Hand missing, told you where to find Geirold's ashes so they can find a way to prevent the vamps from "reassembling" Orlok
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Darke attacked Oloric...
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You started down the river and found it blocked by some hill giants who you mercilessly killed.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Slappy opened chest to find taxidermized fox and a large rattle toy. As he shook it you heard crying off in the distance
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Now following the sound to find the source and “dick check” it to see if it’s giant.

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Found baby giant, it looked to be in danger, but killed wolf that was threatening it
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You argued over who takes the baby, Thermund had the baby following him around
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Decided to peek into a building and found the inhabitants weren't welcoming and shot an arrow at you
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You fought your way part a guard tower and into a massive building, the baby ran in and disappeared from sight
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You rescued roderick who was about to be cooked (lives in shaleston)
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        After having a large number of giants, orcs, and goblins attack you, most of you decided to flee, but Thermund kept fighting and got into hot water.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Gilbert died helping Thermund get away
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You arrived in Edgewater Port and met Dilbert Dilbertson who is a member of the same order of monks as Gilbert was.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        There you:
        <ul class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
          <li>Overheard two drunks at a bar discussing someone who left to fight a giant sea serpent and never returned (though the ship did - being repaired)</li>
          <li>Learned vampires are crossing the sea and getting blood tribute from the town</li>
          <li>The Villlagers believe werewolves are a myth</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        The townsfolk offerred you 300 gold to bring serpents head since it's been destroying trade in the area.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Slappy devises plan to pull squid behind boat and shoot sea monster with cannons, party decides on poisoned bait instead
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">

      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Currently disembarking on The Peir Pressure, crewed by you guys following Gurn's lead.

    <div class="w3-container" id="session5" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 5</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You set off to sea to claim the bounty on a sea creature that's been attacking ships and hurting trade. The enchanter offerred 50gp for them bringing the serpent's head.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Some dock workers attacked you, stating something about a bounty on Slapp's head. You killed two of them and knocked another two unconscious. Unfortunately one died and one got away before you got much information out of them.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You found a goblin stowaway named Skarth who had lost one of his arms when it was pulled off by a bugbear that he pissed off a long time ago. Darke has told him he needs to work off his debt for eating their supplies and trying to get a free ride. He's agreed.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Thermund found a telescope which Gurn used to try and identify a ship in the distance, but could not make out the design, only a pink sail. Meanwhile, a bedside table attacked Dilbert and everyone rushed to kill it. Gurn stayed up top with Skarth who has lost his other arm when he fell a sword went flying. He doesn't seem terribly bothered by the experience.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        There are two large, mounted spear guns on the ship. You decided to poison the spears instead of going through with the previous plan. Unfortunately, both shots missed during the battle. It was a rough battle that mostly took place in the water which almost killed Gurn and Darke. (did you guys take it's head? can't recall)
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You met a very friendly and somewhat flamboyant, bronze dragon named Vurvayssun who was on his way to some sort of meeting about a “darkness” that may be consuming the world... It was all very strange.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You approached an island with a fairly large mountain as a storm formed around it in all directions as if you were in the eye of a hurricane. You docked and had a quick look around the nearest building which had the words "Be seen by nobody" carved into the side. Slappy found some maps and Gurn found a lantern. There was another skeleton in a cellar with a blindfold down around its neck who appeared to have killed themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        After attempting to climb the mountain, you headed east toward a very hot, dry beach. A cactus attacked you. It was slow, but hit very hard. It's been defeated, but now you can see others along the treeline slowly moving toward you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Session 6 -->
    <div class="w3-container" id="session6" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 6</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        As the cacti slowly crawled toward you, you decided not to fight and went up the ladder toward a chapel. There you saw marble buildings off in the distance. You noticed no sounds of wildlife or even insects buzzing. One of the walls of the chapel was knocked in and the interior was dimly lit by a few candles left burning. Inside, you found a skeleton with a dagger stuck into each eye and a blindfold around its neck. Gurn tested out wearing a blindfold, but it didn’t reveal anything.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You were able to piece together that the desecrated temple was previously used to worship Selune, also known as Our Lady of Silver, the Moonmaiden, and the Night White Lady, the goddess of the moon in the Faerûnian pantheon. She holds the portfolios of the moon, stars, navigation, navigators, wanderers, questers, seekers, and non-evil lycanthropes.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Murals on the walls showed you the story of a king named Chorn:
        <ul class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
          <li>A king on a throne, surrounded by food and followers</li>
          <li>A frail, ill-looking woman laying in a bed</li>
          <li>The king, sad and pleading with mages and healers</li>
          <li>A desecrated temple, with followers kneeling at the king’s feet</li>
          <li>Last two are shoddily scribbled: The king being struck by lightning and turning into a head with just one huge eye.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You explored through the broken city collecting clues and fighting off ashy vines that attacked. After finding three 3-foot tall barrels about 2 feet wide at the middle next to some large cannons facing the center of the island. After spotting more ash vines you poked a hole in a barrel, rolled it toward them, lit the trail on fire… and blew up two buildings almost killing two party members with the concussive force.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You left the small city spotting a strange shimmering and bubbling in the water nearby but decided not to investigate. Moving forward you briefly looked over the remains of a very large dragon, some of its bone broken into sharp, jagged pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You worked your way up a tower and onto the mountain. On top was a beautiful shrine, richly decorated with gemstones and gold plating with a glass dome roof. Inside was a single room with a transparent casket in the middle. A sickly-looking young woman laid clutching an ornate urn with etchings of wolves, bears, tigers, rats, and other strange beasts. As you investigated, a seagull flew into the shrine and landed on the casket, staring at you. Shortly after you heard a deep rumble, the temple began to shake, and a giant eye peered into the shrine from above.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You grabbed the urn (Slappy) and quickly descended the steep side of the mountain, losing sight of the massive creature. As you made your way down the beach, a spider crawled out of the trees and locked eyes with you. You then heard a loud bellow and Chorn ran down the mountain after you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Session 7 -->
    <div class="w3-container" id="session7" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 7</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Chorn easily descended the mountain toward you as you fled toward The Pier Pressure. After the spider that was creeping along next to you was gone, Chorn lost sight of you, but continued in that direction. Slappy placed the urn on the below decks on the boat as others began to board. You saw the massive storm off in the distance but decided to ready the ship to sail regardless. Once Chorn found your location he began hurling huge boulders toward the ship, eventually damaging it enough that it was no longer seaworthy. Gurn landed a couple blows on Chorn’s right leg.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Dilbert ran for the urn and everyone found various hiding places along the shore while Darke turned invisible to keep an eye on things. Chorn began to wander around the island seemingly aimlessly. Thurmund, Gorn, and Slappy headed toward the cannons near the wrecked village. Nemeia, Darke, and Dilbert searched for other ideas and were spotted by Chorn who once again began to attack, landing a blow on Darke. He then stood motionless for a while with his eyes clouded over before disappearing back into the trees.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Dilbert went for the cannons while Nemeia and Darke went into the tree line, starting at the only spot visible that was covered in spiderwebs and dead bodies. They were attacked by giant spiders and held their own for a while but were overcome and shouted for help. Dilbert changed directions and ran in to help. Between the three of them they dispatched the remaining spiders. Meanwhile, Slappy, Thurmund, and Gurn were getting the cannons ready. Gurn broke off to clear the annoying cactus creature from the beach.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        As Dilbert, Nemeia, and Darke ran to join the group, Chorn came out of the trees between you. He was weakened by a cannon ball and other ranged attacks. You closed in, taking out his right leg and then targeting his eye. After a series of attacks, Slappy landed the final blow, destroying the creature’s eye and killing it.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Looking through his pockets Slapy, found a bag of holding. Inside it was a dark blue rhomboid shaped stone. Darke showed interest in the stone, so Slappy handed it to him. Gurn hacked off an ear that is about the same size as Thurmund, but surprisingly not terribly heavy. After looting a bit, you used some of the wood and took some time patching up and raising the ship. You are now back at sea, heading towards Edgewater port with the urn.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Session 8 -->
    <div class="w3-container" id="session8" style="margin-top:25px">
      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-dark-cyan"><b>Session 8</b></h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Thurmund went to speak to the alchemist to see if they had any gun powder, which they did not. Meanwhile Nemeia headed to the hospital while Darke and the rest of the group went to speak to a shipwright. Nemeia found that the hospital beds which were completely full last time you passed through Edgewater Port were now all empty. After speaking Vanuath, Nimeia learned that the people had stopped paying the vampires their tribute.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Darke found the shipwrights appentice and was told that Girard, the shipwright, was expecting them and has the reward for killing the sea creature. He headed to the tavern to find Girard very drunk and uncooperative. Girard said he was paying less than the agreed amount since they didn't bring back the whole creature, only it's head. At this point, Thurmund got very upset and threatened Girard who laughed in his face. Darke stepped in and threatened to banish him to another plane of existance. This got his attention, and he handed over the gold.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Everyone stocked up at the general store, then some went to the enchanter (Emeny's Elements) while others went to the alchemist (Peter's Mirror). Thurmund's attempts to haggle did not go well and he once again turned to anger, threatening Emeny who stared at him and cleared her throat while pointing to the ceiling. Looking up, Thurmund saw rows and rows of blades dangling above them, held by some unseen force. Everyone was kicked out and the shop was magically sealed.

        Due to a miscommunication among Nemeia and Peter, he ran out shortly after their transaction thinking that the owner of the general store was sending him a message that she wanted to hook up... she did not.

        Everyone left for Fort Lever to speak to Oloric, but night fell before you arrived. You setup camp with a lookout in a wooded area by the trail. There were sounds of something approached which turned out to be a deer. It was killed and Slappy happily yelled out BREAKFAST! Thurmund and Gurn began butchering the deer, but some of Helmuth and Margravine's thralls were attracted to the noise and began stirring up the group ("aw... do you miss your puppy?", etc.). A fight broke out, but the thralls were quickly dispatched
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You arrived at Fort Lever. Gurn informed Oloric of the thralls, that the vampires have likely returned, and that enchantress is probably holding her own with the locked down shop. Oloric updated you on the situation and handed you a map with the last known locations of the Orlok's body parts:
        <ul class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
          <li>Orlock's left arm was given to Azamarim, a powerful mage. It is guarded on a small island due west of Edgewater port.</li>
          <li>Orlok's right arm was given to a giant sea creature named Allod'Zig. Oloric could only provide a rough location. It could be anywhere, but is likely around that spot. Allod'Zig looks like a giant turtle of sorts.</li>
          <li>Orlok's left leg was given to the Pothik Wraiths, a sect of necromancers that used their power for good (extending life, lessening the need for sustenance, regrowing lost limbs). They've not been heard from for some time.</li>
          <li>Orlok's right leg was given to the Merfolk. They have taken it to an underwater city, Ocecia.</li>
          <li>Orlok's Torso was given to the Metallic Dragons who's council meets at a mountain in the far west.</li>
          <li>Orlok's head is located in what is known as The Chaotic Cluster, but no additional information is available yet. Oloric has left to travel to a lycanthrope dwarven fortress to the north in search of more information.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Oloric took the urn and left to meet the Lycan's knowledge keepers to find out what can be done with the ashes. This location is secret, he would not tell you where it is located, but he was getting a ship ready.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Everyone headed back to Edgewater Port to find bodies scattered around and buildings smashed or burned down. The only structure left standing is Emeny's Elements. You did however notice a very familiar looking bugbear digging through the remains of one of the buildings. He looked and sounded exactly like Dilbert and introduced himself as Billbert Billerson. He wasn't exactly the nicest to everyone, but he was good for a laugh. He left mid conversation once he got bored with everyone.

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Looking around the rubble and ash, Slappy decided to search for any valuables left behind in the buildings. Thurmund and Nemeia went to investigate the strange fog surrounding the enchantress building. Thurmund stuck his hand in, then stepped in. When approaching the door, he was blinded by a  massive beam of light  that burned him and threw him back 10 feet. Nemeia went to knock on the door and call out to whoever was inside. Getting no response, she tried to door handle which activated a trap that sent a crossbow bolt into her foot. At this point, they heard a window open and close from the side of the building. Thurmund went over to investigate and was again fried by a beam of radiant light shooting down from above. Gurn then carefully moved around the building from a distance, but was unable to see inside past a faint glow of purple light from inside. Thurmund and Nemeia tried to explain that they were there to help and could use any information the person inside might have. The response was telling them to leave or they would “get another one”. Gurn then tried to persuade the occupants to open the door with food. The food was placed on the ground, then some berries magically appeared next to them, but there was no response from inside. Thurmund again called out to the occupant and was shot at with a crossbow bolt that barely missed his head. You all decided to leave the area. Thurmund etched a message into some nearby stones and tossed them near the door. They read: "We're looking for Orlok's body, headed to Amazonian island" and "Any help you can give."
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You all sat down for a bit to rest, then headed to the ship which was the only one not burnt and sank at the pier. A small note was placed at the entryway that read: “See you soon.” Thurmund searched the ship and found that the silverware was missing while Slappy checked for mimics by stabbing every object on board he could find. (He may have developed a complex…). You sailed to the island where Oloric marked down Azamarim’s location. On the way, you met a lone, crazed man on a ship who had the ability to control water. He was forcing running water at your feel and checking your mouths. Thurmund briefly kidnapped him, but the fled back to his ship and took off. You chose not to pursue.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        You arrived at the island and followed some tracks to a nearby trap door which led down to an unnaturally formed cavern. Slappy searched a nearby skeleton to find a key and a note with some cryptic writing. After using the key to open the first door, another was down the hallway with a large dwarven face carved into it. The door was snoring. Everyone tried to quietly approach, but Thurmund’s armor scraped against the wall making a loud screeching noise. The door awoke and immediately began to insult you while hinting that they would need to prove themselves if they were going to go deeper into the caverns. After suffering through a few minutes of insults, you discovered that the door would open if it said “one”. Gurn got it to repeat the word, the face disappeared, and the door opened.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        Each room entered contained some sort of challenge: A fight with animated objects, a mural of snakes with hidden switches, a steep drop down to another level, an encounter with large fleshy golems, and a moat of acid. After almost every challenge the door reappeared to somewhat congratulate, but mostly insult everyone. Before the next room, he advised you to leave any letters you may have for your next of kin with him before proceeding. At this point, Thurmund and Slappy were pretty badly beaten and Nemeia is very low on spells they can cast. Everyone chose to proceed.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-cyan">
        In the next room a chest overflowing with gemstones and coins of platinum, gold and silver sits in the center of the room. Directly behind the chest, standing tall with their neck stretched to the ceiling is a large grey stone statue of a dragon. Searching the chest, you found that there were exactly two onyx gems, two diamonds, and two emeralds. Using the information on the cryptic note you found, you discovered that you would need to replace the eyes in the statue. Slappy first tried to jam gold coins into the sockets, but they did not fit well. All the gold in the room, and picked up from previous rooms disappeared. Thurmund then grabbed two onyx gemstones and stuck one into each eye socket of the statue. It began to feel warm, then move, the stone crumbled off of the outside of its body and it stepped off the pedestal on which it was standing. You are now face to face with a young black dragon.
